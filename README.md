# Portfolio Website - samshurts.github.io

This repository holds my personal portfolio site, hosted on github.io and custom built using HTML markup, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript to control the image slideshow. The site also features a navbar, a contact form and a looping background video, and links to my GitHub profile as well as my resume.
